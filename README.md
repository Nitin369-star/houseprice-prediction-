House Price Prediction
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and comparison, evaluation, and deployment of the model.

🚀 Project Overview
Objective: Predict median house values in Boston suburbs based on various features.

Tech Stack: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Google Colab

📊 Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository — Boston Housing

Features: 13 attributes (e.g., CRIM, RM, AGE, TAX, etc.) and the target variable (MEDV - Median value of homes in $1000s).

🛠️ Key Steps
Data loading and exploration

Data cleaning and preprocessing (imputation, scaling, stratified split)

Feature engineering (e.g., composite features)

Model training with Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

Evaluation using RMSE and cross-validation

Visualization of feature importance and model results

Model serialization for deployment

📝 Results
Best model: Random Forest Regressor

Test RMSE: 2.87

Findings: Ensemble models outperform simple regressors. Feature engineering and robust cross-validation improved prediction accuracy.
